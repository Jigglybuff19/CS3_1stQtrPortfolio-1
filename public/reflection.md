### List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

1. **Loops** -  concept has been present since Grade 8 with C++ and helps people repeat code efficiently without typing it over and over again. This can come in a lot of ways but the main ones that I am familiar with are for, while, and do while. The format usually has 4 main parts in initialization (ex. int i = 0;), condition to keep on running the code (ex. i > 0), code that continously runs, and at the end the update (ex. i++). 

2. **Booleans** - this is a type of data that can true or false and 1 or 0. This can be used in a lot of creative ways but the most common way for me is in if statements wherein the value of the boolean determines if the code inside the statement is run.

3. **If statements, else, if else, etc** - main way that I am adept in to add a "decision" feeling to your code. If statements first check if the variabe or value passes the condition put upon it then runs the code inside the corresponding statement. This only happens once unlike loops and if it does not match the condition, it will either check other if statements or automatically do the else statement (if applicable) or sometimes do nothing.

4. **Functions**- saves a block of code that can be called multiple times in a program. This dramatically lessens the length of your code and makes it easier to edit and read. Functions can store almost any command from if statements to loops or even a mix of both. 
    
5. **Order of priority** - points to what the program will read and prioritize first in your code. The order goes as follows: !(), *, /, +, -, <, >, ==, &&, ||. This is essential to remember as it can change the output of your code even if it looks like nothing is wrong. 

### List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed. 

1. **Arrays** - A way to store multiple values all in the same variable name. I understand how it works and why it can be useful but it is the how that I need help in. There are a lot of times I realize too late that I could have used arrays in a problem to make it easier but I do not know how to put it efficiently.

2. **Push and Pop** - push and pop is a really cool technique that is used to add or remove values from an array. But due to the fact not a lot of assesments have needed it, I found myself forgetting how to use it and when to use it. Especially its syntax. 

3. **Calling CSS and HTML designs** - I sometimes forget the exact format to call these designs and having to look it up is tedious so I hope in the future I can memorize it so I can design my websites or outputs better and faster. 

4. **Adding designs in general** - while it has been discussed only very shortly, I know that is might be the second most important part of coding after the code itself. Without designs, your project becomes bland and uninteresting, same as everyone else's. If I can make my outputs look way better, it would be very cool to show to other people.

5. **Different ways of doing the same thing** - Even though it is a broad topic, I still feel like I need to learn more ways of doing the same thing. Whether it be the simple things or the complex ones, I know that with more tools under my belt, the better my products will be. 

 ### Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

 > I will try implementing these concepts in my code even if it is not required to get the practice I need. Hopefully by doing this I can get more used to them and be able to use them in future projects. I also (if I have time) will try to watch videos about coding in general as I actually like Computer Science and want to be more versed in it.

 ### In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
 > The activities that I find more effective in general are when we get the freedom to make our own small short code projects after learning a certain lesson just to see how we can apply and edit it according to our needs. This is the best way for me personally as it makes the lesson more fun and makes it so I can actually use it in real life coding. 

 > The activities I find less effective are the google forms as I feel that lesson does not really stick with me as I do not actually use the methods taught, instead I click a button for multiple choice answers. I may sometimes remember it but its nowhere close to actually using the lesson in vscode.
